# Labview Module for Simplex Algorithm based Adaptive Optics in Single Molecule Switching Nanoscopy (SMSN)

This package contains an example lab view code module for implementing Nelder-Mead Simplex Algorithm for AO and adaptive PSF shaping in SMSN. 

# Main Code Name: 

Simplex-AO.vi

# Other Files

The subvis required by Simplex-AO can be found in the folder “subvis”. Additionally, there is an example file named Initial_Simplex_Guess_Example, containing initial, depth dependent guesses for the simplex algorithm.
